# Power_ranking
I wrote this program initially to replace the old ranking system my Yugioh club had. It also gave me a chance to learn and experiment with Python and its libraries.

The ranking algorithm gives numeric values to each win, loss, and draw each player has in their tournament history and *sorts and displays in the pretty tables format. Draws are not factored into win%. Invites are essentially bonus points for placing well at regional or premier tournament.


*Obviously bubblesort isn't the most optimal sorting algorithm, so it will be slower for larger data sets.
